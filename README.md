BACKGROUND: 
IPEG2 is a follow-up experiment to IPEG that aim to assess whether the prosocial simulation effect (PSE) (i.e., imagine helping a person will lead to an increase in willingness to help him/her) can be generalized to different targets and scenarios (i.e., will imagine helping one person increase willingness to help another person in need in a different situation than the one they imagined?). For all trials, The peron participants imagined (simulation targets) were always different from the person they are asked to help (helping targets) but they may differ across sex and age. The following research questions were assess:

1. Assess whether PSE can be generalized to helping a different person in need in a different situation than the one they imagined.
2. Examine whether this generalization effect is graded across similarity between helping and simulation targets, as well as situations (e.g., will participants express a greater willingness to help similar helping targets in similar sitiuation to the ones they imagined?).

IPEG2_analysis.rmd contains most updated scripts for analyses in IPEG2. A list of measures collected from the experiments are included in IPEG2_analysis.rmd. In addition, Bayes_scripts.R and LMM_scripts.R can be found IPE_IPEF_Analysis folder.
